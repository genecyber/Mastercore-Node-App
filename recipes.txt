- name is somewhat odd.  When Columbus started this whole confusing
- thing with Indians and peppers that weren't what he thought they were,
- the Arawak people of the Bahamas called their capsicums "aji."

Homemade Paneer

INGREDIENTS:

- 1 liter whole milk
- 1/2 lemon or lime - juiced, or 1-3 tsp vinegar
- muslin cloth (or anything that's a bit thin)


METHOD:

1. Bring the milk to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning or sticking.

2. When it comes to a boil, stir in the acid and cook for another 2-3 minutes; in a few minutes, you see small curds floating on top. Wait till they get bigger to form small stone-like granules, about five minutes. The solids will clump together (known as channa or curd) and the remaining liquid will become a thin watery white (known as whey).

3. Now turn off heat and allow to sit for a few minutes to cool.

4. Strain through the muslin cloth. When the liquid is mostly drained out, lift the cloth by the corners and twist to squeeze out remaining liquid. You can put the cloth with the paneer in it to sit on a colander over the sink for an hour or so till all excess water drips away. What you get at this stage is cottage cheese. If you let it sit for an additional 12 to 24 hrs at room temperature to develop acidity, and then cook it further you will be able to make ricotta cheese.

5. To make paneer, press the cloth-covered cheese under a 5kg (or anything heavy enough) weight for up to two hours. I folded the cloth around the cheese, then pressed it to shape like a rectangular bar, and put it between two heavy wooden cutting boards. Put something heavier on top of the cutting board to increase the weight. Leave it like this for a couple of hours.

6. This makes the paneer firm and hard. Now you can store it in an airtight box and refrigerate till ready to use. You can even cut it into cubes and store them.SOURCE: http://funnfud.blogspot.com/2008/04/how-to-make-paneer-ricotta-cheese-at.html

- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, cut into big
- chunks
- Ω cup cocoa
- 4 eggs, beaten well
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups sugar
- 1 Ω cup all-purpose flour
- 1/8 teaspoon salt

- melted
- Ω cup milk or evaporated
- milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 cups mini-marshmallows, or 3 cup
- marshmallows, quartered


METHOD:

1. Directions:To make the cake, heat the oven to 350∞F. Grease and flour a 13-by-9-inch pan. In a medium saucepan, combine the butter and the cocoa and cook over medium heat, stirring now and then, until the butter is melted and the mixture is well blended, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the beaten eggs, vanilla, sugar, flour, salt, and pecans, and beat with a wooden spoon or spatula or with a mixer at low speed until the batter is well combined and smooth, and the flour has disappeared.

2. Quickly pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake at the 350∞F for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cake springs back when touched gently in the center and is beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan.

3. Prepare the frosting while the cake bakes; so that you will be ready to poor it over the hot cake. In a medium bowl, combine the confectionersí sugar and the cocoa, and stir to mix them well. Add the melted butter, milk and vanilla, and use a large spoon or mixer at low speed to beat everything together well. Set aside until the cake is done.

4. Remove the cake from the oven, scatter the marshmallows over the top, and return the cake to the hot oven form about 3 minutes, to soften the marshmallows.

5. Place the cake, still in the pan, on a wire rack or a folded kitchen towel. Pour the frosting all over the marshmallow-dotted cake, and cool to room temperature. Cut into small squares and serve.

Outback Bloomin Onion

INGREDIENTS:

- Dipping Sauce
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 2 teaspoons ketchup
- 2 tablespoons cream-style horseradish
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon dried oregano
- ds ground black pepper
- ds cayenne pepper
- The Onion
- 1 egg
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 5 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/8 teaspoon cumin
- 1 giant Spanish onion (3/4
- pound or
- more)
- Vegetable oil for frying
- pepper


METHOD:

1. Prepare the dipping sauce by combining all of the ingredients in a small bowl. Keep the sauce covered in your refrigerator until needed. Beat the egg and combine it with the milk in a medium bowl big enough to hold the onion. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, peppers, oregano, thyme, and cumin. Now it''s time to slice the onion-this is the trickiest step. First slice 3/4 inch to 1 inch off the top and bottom of the onion. Remove the papery skin. Use a thin knife to cut a 1-inch diameter core out of the middle of the onion. Now use a very sharp, large knife to slice the onion several times down the center to create the "petals" of the completed onion. First slice through the center of the onion to about three-fourths of the way down. Turn the onion 90℉ and slice it again in an "x" across the first slice. Keep slicing the sections in half, very carefully, until you''ve cut the onion 16 times. Do not cut down to the bottom. The last 8 slices are a little hairy, just use a steady hand and don''t worry if your onion doesn''t look like a perfect flower. It''ll still taste good. Spread the "petals" of the onion apart. The onion sections tend to stick together, so you''ll want to separate them to make coating easier. Dip the onion in the milk mixture, and then coat it liberally with the dry ingredients. Again separate the "petals" and sprinkle the dry coating between them. Once you''re sure the onion is well-coated, dip it back into the wet mixture and into the dry coating again. This double dipping makes sure you have a well- coated onion because some of the coating tends to wash off when you fry. Let the onion rest in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes while you get the oil ready. Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep pot to 350℉. Make sure you use enough oil to completely cover the onion when it fries. Fry the onion right side up in the oil for 10 minutes or until it turns brown. When the onion has browned, remove it from the oil and let it drain on a rack or paper towels. Open the onion wider from the center so that you can put a small dish of the dipping sauce in the center. You may also use plain ketchup.

Paula's Home Cookin 5.6 2008

INGREDIENTS:

- I started out wanting to put together some kind of cookbook of recipes
- I have collected over the years from family and friends and everything
- else I found that I have tried and liked. I thought it would be nice to
- pass it on to all of you.


METHOD:

1. Then came figuring out just how to do it. I found software online to use for having a cookbook published, ones for sharing totally online, and finally this one. I have been looking for over a year. This one has all the different features I wanted. It can be printed as a book or recipe file or just used as a program. You can edit, delete, import, export, and add recipes including photos. I have printed some of my favorites for your recipe boxes.

2. The program with my recipes are all on the enclosed flash drive and can be used from it on any computer.

3. You are all experiencing positive life changes this year, making homes and families of your own. I want this to be part of my legacy to you all. Remember me when when you prepare something from this cookbook and smile.

4. I LOVE YOU ALL AND AM SO PROUD OF YOU

Pineapple Bread Pudding

INGREDIENTS:

- 2 cans (8 ounce each) crushed
- pineapple in juice
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (I have never used
- salt, but I like salt, so it can't
- hurt)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 3 tablespoons flour
- 3 eggs, beaten (I use at least 5 eggs
- beaten)
- 2 cups fresh bread cubes (We have
- it
- down to a science Forget
- the 2 cup Its
- 14 sl of white bread, the shitty,
- gummy, butter-topped kind, but brioche
- or
- challah would be even
- better.)
- 6 tablespoons melted butter ( are you
- kidding me? Forget this 6
- tablespoon
- crap It's an
- entire stick and keep an
- extra stick
- on hand in addition to
- that because
- you
- should put some on top
- before you bake
- it)
- This recipe doesn't
- include it, but I
- also add in about 1/2 to
- 3/4 of a cup
- of
- half and half or whole
- milk. It'll
- work if you don't use it
- at all
- though, but
- it makes it richer and
- more custardy.
- Also the person who wrote
- this recipe
- forgot the most important
- thing A
- ts of vanilla and by a
- teaspoon
- I mean hold the spoon over
- the bowl
- and
- let it overflow some
- because vanilla
- is good.


METHOD:

1. Combine the undrained pineapple with salt, sugar, and flour and the vanilla and the half and half or milk. Stir in the beaten eggs. Toss bread cubes with the melted butter OK, so this person forgot another KEY STEP. You MUST toast all the bread in the toaster first and then cut it into cubes. It''s gross if you don''t toast the bread first. You must trust me on this and TOAST THE BREAD, THEN toss it in melted butter then fold into the pineapple mixture. Pour into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish I don''t know what the hell this means. We bake it in a greased 9 x 13 Pyrex baking dish. Also top it with some little pieces of butter before baking because this helps its get brown and crunchy on top and if you want to get extremely fancy you can even decorate it with maraschino cherries but this should be reserved for very special occasions only and bake at 350∞ for 40 to 50 minutes. Make sure it''s set and not all jiggly and runny in the middle and let it get nice and brown on top because browness tastes good. You can serve it hot or cold, as a side dish (especially if you''re in the South because sweets are considered vegetables and salads) or as a dessert. We always have it with ham. Sometimes its nice heated up for dessert with vanilla ice cream on top. People who have never eaten this freak the hell out when they eat it. I''m just warning you.
